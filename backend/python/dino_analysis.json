The second Ankylosaurus is positioned slightly behind and to the side, appearing to be accompanying the 'vehicle'. Both dinosaurs are heavily armored with bony plates and spikes. The larger dinosaur has a long, club-like tail. The children inside the enclosure appear to be looking forward with expressions of excitement or wonder.",
